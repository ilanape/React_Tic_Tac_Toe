# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe game interactively.

- Indicates when a player has won.

- Stores the game's history as the game progresses.

- Allows players to review game's history and see previous versions of the board.

Further practice solutions:
  1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
  
  2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
  
  3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
