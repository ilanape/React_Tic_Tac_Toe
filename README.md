# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

-Lets you play tic-tac-toe

-Indicates when a player has won the game

-Stores a game’s history as a game progresses

-Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board

Further practice solutions:
  1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
  
  2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
  
  3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
